# Supply-Chain-Data
This project involves analyzing and refining a flawed supply chain dataset to enhance its accuracy and usability for business insights.

## Introduction

Supply chain analytics is an essential aspect of data-driven decision-making, enabling businesses in industries such as manufacturing, retail, healthcare, and logistics to optimize operations and achieve greater efficiency. By analyzing raw data related to the movement of products and services from suppliers to customers, businesses can uncover valuable insights and opportunities for improvement.

In this project, the primary goal is to explore revenue, manufacturing costs, profits margins, shipping costs, and logistics for a cosmetics company using SQL queries exclusively. By working directly with raw data, the focus remains on understanding the underlying structures, extracting meaningful information, and performing detailed analysis without reliance on visualization tools. This approach not only strengthens SQL proficiency but also fosters critical thinking in interpreting data directly.

## Objective

• Correcting revenue inconsistencies by creating a new REVENUE column, ensuring realistic values.

• Conducting profitability analysis, cost efficiency evaluations, and correlation studies between costs (manufacturing/shipping) and revenue.

• Generating insights to support decision-making and optimize operational efficiency

The project demonstrates advanced SQL query writing, data adjustment, and documentation best practices for effective data analytics
